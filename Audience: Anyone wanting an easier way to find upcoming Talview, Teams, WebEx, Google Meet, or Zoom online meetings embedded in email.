Audience: Anyone wanting an easier way to find upcoming Talview, Teams, WebEx, Google Meet, or Zoom online meetings embedded in email.
Below are search strings that worked when I could not find one of the above meeting invitations. 
These are not guaranteed to work in all cases but I have found them helpful.
To get started, open your email client and search for the indicated text strings in the email client search bar.
*** Some of the search strings below require quotation marks (") to work correctly, and some have TWO search strings. (E.g. Google Meet, Zoom.)
*** If there are no quotation marks (") then do not add them, simply copy the search string and paste into the email client's search bar on ONE LINE. (E.g. Teams, WebEx.)
