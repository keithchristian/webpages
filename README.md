Do yourself a favor and create a dedicated email account

 1. Before starting your job search, set up a totally separate gmail, outlook, yahoo, hotmail, etc. JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT for future job
    searches.
 2. By having a dedicated JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT, the unstoppable deluge of job alert emails will be kept out of your personal email, making
    it easier to locate both personal and job search emails.
 3. Use the JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT address on LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, and others, and on all job search correspondence.
 4. Good to check your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT frequently.

 

What suddenly being contacted by a significant number of recruiters in one day may mean.

 1. That a high profile employer has released a job desctiption requiring a large number of candidates and the job carries with it a high
    hourly rate which translates into good income for the recruiting company.
 2. It means that you're probably a top candidate for the position, since recruiters look over the skillset and start searching LinkedIn and
    Dice for those skillsets, and your profile is an ideal, or near ideal match.

 

During and after the search

 1. Even AFTER you have a new position, you'll still be contacted by recruiters, a good thing.
 2. The job emails will continue to pile up in your inbox, (hopefully in your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT'S INBOX.)
 3. Save interesting jobs in a folder, not that the job would be around in 6 months, but by having the recruiter's contact info you could
    inquire about similar positions.
 4. For contractors, the job search is perpetual, as employers can release you for anything, and probably never tell you the "real" reason.
 5. My second contract in the 2023-2024 cycle was canceled after working only 40 days. (I had good performance reviews, too.) Full time
    employees were also let go, so it wasn't only me.
 6. So.....keep in mind that as a contractor, TODAY could be your last day on the job, since you can be released at any time. There is little
    or no warning given in the 2024 time frame.
 7. Keep your personal effects organized at work and your desk drawers free of junk, so that you can vacate in 5 - 10 minutes.
 8. At my most recent contract job in early 2024, I spent the last hour checking in code written that morning, and going over the essentials
    with my mentor as a goodwill gesture.
 9. When suddenly terminated, your co-workers (both employees of the company and other contractors) are as shocked as you are that "today is
    your last day."
10. If you find your co-workers to be reasonable and pleasant people, consider swapping contact info (email is probably best, phone numbers are
    best kept private,) early in the contract so that later on, you can provide references for each other.
11. If you have swapped contact info, stay in touch every few months to "keep the connections alive."

 

Keep your current job

 1. If possible, don't quit your job until you have another one.
 2. If you've lost your job, take the first reasonable offer you get even if it's not optimal, cash flow is important.
 3. If the job you took simply for cash flow isn't optimal, continue the job search. Contractors can generally quit at any time.
 4. One or two weeks' notice to your supervisor is good business.
 5. You should probably ask the recruiter working with the client to notify them for you, so that both parties know simultaneously.

 

Ideas for what to include in your resume

 1. While searching, triple check Remote or Hybrid, the hourly pay rates, etc. It's too easy to apply to a job only to discover later that it
    may not be a good fit.
 2. Before sending a resume, or clicking EASY APPLY, verify the hourly rate, so that you don't apply for a job with too little pay.
 3. Google now has a dedicated job search presentation, truly amazing and worthwhile. Search terms like "Remote Linux Bash job" work very well.
 4. Best to post the same resume on LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, and others to minimize confusion when recruiters are reviewing your resume.
 5. If the job requirements list certain skills, put those skills below the Education section, so the recruiter or hiring manager doesn't have
    to look for them.
 6. As you write your resume, save it frequently to avoid data loss.
 7. Until 2022, I had never heard of a recruiter offering to re-structure a resume for me. The first solid contact I had in the 2022 job search
    asked if he could re-structure my resume and I told him yes, please do so. He said, "No one knows what a resume should look like in any
    given job market. But I know, because I'm a recruiter."
 8. It's even worth letting the recruiter know in the initial email or phone call that you'd appreciate suggestions for tailoring your resume
    to ensure the best first impression. This can only help your job search efforts.

 

Keeping your resume fresh

 1. Recruiters are up early on Mondays looking for fresh resumes to recommend to their clients.
 2. Keep your resume fresh by adding a bit more detail to a skill or two and updating the filename.
 3. I use a filename like 20240601_skillname_firstname_lastname.docx which is updated over the weekend and uploaded to the main job boards:
    LinkedIn, Dice, and others.
 4. This way, recruiters searching for "new resumes in the last 24 hours" can be more easily found by virtue of the new date and the updated
    content.

 

Resume heading example

 1. The resume heading should be centered at the top of the page, and could look like this:
     1. First name, Last name
     2. City, State, Zip code (I never put street addresses in resumes.)
     3. Your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT email address.
     4. Phone number (if desired, but makes it easier for your recruiter to find it.)
     5. https://www.linkedin.com/in/firstname.lastname (Or however your LinkedIn ID appears.)

 

Education list example

 1. Put education (trade schools, colleges, etc.) below the heading of your resume, i.e. below the linkedin.com line:
     1. Associates' Degree, A-1 Technical Academy, Pittsburgh, PA. (Year graduated: 2023)
     2. B.A. Physics, Such-and-such University, New York, NY. (Year graduated: 2026)

 

A common format for previous employers and dates employed

 1. Company, Full Time or Contractor, start date --- end date --- job title

 

More hints for a good resume

 1. If it's been awhile since you've used a secondary skillset, e.g. If it's been 15 years since you worked with PL/1, be sure to let the
    recruiter know that, he or she will understand.
 2. Below the current job or most recent job, explain in 90 - 100 words what skills you learned in the position and how you used them to
    provide value to the company vs. keeping the coffee pot on. This is a good place to provide a few details for your next potential employer.
 3. In every one of the reverse-chronological job histories, briefly mention how your primary skillset (and others) were used.
 4. Use this as the descriptive line above each separate entry in your reverse chronological job history:

 

Previous job example 1

 1. FICTITIOUS COMPANY NAME BELOW:
 2. Tomorrow's Most Awesome SuperKewl Technologies, Contractor, 2023 --- 2025 --- Linux System Engineer (Orange Ball Cap Linux,) Operations
    Engineer 2.2
 3. Used Orange Ball Cap Linux to streamline processes and increase profits by 25%.
 4. Tuned all OBC Linux servers for maximum performance. Skillsets used: Docker, Java, Bash, Python, Scala, Kotlin, Nmap, Traceroute, Ping,
    Wireshark, Tcpdump, Sendmail, DNS.

 

Previous job example 2

 1. FICTITIOUS COMPANY NAME BELOW:
 2. The Last Financial Management Company You'll Ever Need, Full Time, 2025 --- 2028 --- Linux DevOps Engineer (Magenta Magic Linux,) Web
    systems designer.
 3. Magenta Magic Linux and DevOps utilized for startup Financial company. Skillsets used: Docker, Private Cloud, Perl, Bash, Python, Kotlin,
    Java, Traceroute, Ping, Wireshark, Tcpdump, Sendmail, DNS.

 

When your resume is complete

 1. Save a backup copy. Go to your home page on LinkedIn and update these areas:
 2. Your Headline, which appears under your profile picture. Click the pencil icon to the right of your picture. Edit the headline and put the
    most compelling skill sets there, start the line with 10 years of Linux, or 5 years of PostgreSQL, or 2 years of Docker, or whatever your
    BEST skillset is, then follow that with other important skills.
 3. In the same area, click "Add profile section" and create or update your profile. This should be equal to or closely match your resume.
 4. To the left of the Add profile section, click Open to, and click Finding a new job or Providing services. This will add a green border to
    your profile picture and helps get attention quickly.
 5. After updating your profile and Open to areas, click Take a skill quiz in your area of expertise. These are fairly easy to pass and when
    you do, a trophy icon will appear next to your name in job listings, another way to attract attention.
 6. This seems to mark your profile as updated/new material, and gets attention.
 7. When I've done this there is a small to medium spike in emails and calls.

 

While waiting for calls, emails, txts, and interviews.....

 1. Know your desired hourly rate before replying to a posting. $40, $50, $60, $70, $80, $90 per hour, etc. Do not be afraid to ask for your
    true worth, but also be prepared to accept the going rate, especially if you're out of work.
 2. After the resume(s) are completed and uploaded, go into "maintenance mode."
 3. Watch for missed phone calls, txt messages, and check your job search email account frequently.
 4. Make sure your voicemail inbox has space.
 5. Any new voicemail could lead to your next job.
 6. I've come to the conclusion that direct calls from a recruiter are the best way to be contacted about a new job, this generally means there
    is a high level of interest in your skillset.
 7. When a recruiter calls you on the phone or sends a text, the vast majority have already emailed the JD (Job Description) to you, so I've
    learned there is generally no need to ask them if they've sent the JD to you.
 8. A method to reduce interruptions after receiving emails and TXTs: reply to the TXT or email with a message similar to the following:
     1. Hello (Name of recruiter,) The job looks very interesting. I'd like to discuss this on a phone call.
     2. Are you available to talk after 4pm when I am off work?
     3. Please send a TXT a few minutes before you'd like to talk to be sure I am in a non-work area.

 

Things to remember during recruiter cold-calls and interviews

 1. Find out the highest probable rate early in the call: About 30 seconds into the call with a recruiter, ask about the upper dollar per hour
    rate the client is willing to pay, since some jobs may not pay as much as you expected. If the amount is nowhere near your current rate,
    let the recruiter know your rate, politely thank them, and invite them to contact you again if the client is willing to pay your desired
    rate.
 2. STILL.....in a difficult economy, be flexible; if unemployed, you need "A JOB," even if the rate is lower than you'd otherwise accept.
 3. It is essentially impossible to increase your rate to what it should have been after agreeing to the rate in the email that will be sent to
    you to finalize the deal. Know your desired rate !!
 4. As a contractor, there are usually no benefits included (but ask if any are,) if not, then set your rate high enough to provide the level
    of benefits at your last full time position. It seems $2000/month is a good average value to start with.
 5. To get the $2000/month to buy benefits, increase your hourly rate by an extra $12.50 ($2000/(8 hrs/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month)) will
    provide the $2000 extra per month for benefits.
 6. It's up to you to take care of yourself (and your family) by charging an adequate hourly rate.

 

In-Person or Video interviews

 1. Write down 4 to 6 questions pertinent to the position, so that you won't forget when the interviewer asks "What questions do you have for
    us?"
 2. Write down names and positions held.
 3. Best to wear a freshly pressed white shirt, open collar, and a blue or gray jacket during the interview.
 4. Take notes after the interview and study new technologies and terms that are discussed.
 5. In my recent online interviews, recruiters and clients seem to prefer that you look straight ahead to monitor your engagement.

 

Things to remember the first few days of your new job

 1. It's unlikely that your new coworkers know your skills and capabilities; they probably haven't seen your resume, be patient as they try to
    help you navigate the new environment.

 

When you decide it's time to look for a new job

 1. I've found it best to never mention to anyone that you're looking for a new job.
 2. Even though above I state that the job search is perpetual, or seems to be, best not to discuss it in any work environment, as your current
    client may find out and plan to release you sooner rather than later.
 3. Generally, the first three quarters of the year are the best time, but January can be slow as well. In the fourth quarter, hiring usually
    slows down due to the holidays, but resumes quickly afterward, still, continue updating and posting your resume on LinkedIn, Dice, and
    Indeed, and others. I've been hired and onboarded in November and December!
 4. Many companies have layoffs in the fourth quarter, so there is more competition for jobs from recently laid off contractors.

 

15 to 20 minutes before your team's online morning meeting:

 1. Boot the work computer to allow Windows, MacOS, etc., updates to install.
 2. Turn on the camera and preview your appearance before the meeting starts.
 3. Turn camera and microphone OFF on Teams, Zoom, Webex, etc.
 4. Before turning on the camera back on, put on a smile.
 5. Join the meeting 5 minutes early.
