</ol>
<li type="A">Do yourself a favor and open a dedicated email account</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li type="1">Before starting your job search, set up a totally separate gmail, outlook, yahoo, hotmail, etc. JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT for future job searches.</li>
<li type="1">By having a dedicated JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT, the unstoppable deluge of job alert emails will be kept out of your personal email, making it easier to locate both personal and job search emails.</li>
<li type="1">Use the JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT address on LinkedIn, Dice, Indeed, etc., and on all job search correspondence.</li>
<li type="1">Be sure to check your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT regularly.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">During and after the search</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Even AFTER you have a new position, you'll still be contacted by recruiters, potentially a good thing.
<li type="1">The job emails will continue to pile up in your inbox, (hopefully in your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT.)</li>
<li type="1">Save interesting jobs in a folder, not that the job would be around in 6 months, but by having the recruiter's contact info you could inquire about similar positions.</li>
<li type="1">For contractors, the job search is perpetual.</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<li type="A">Keep your current job</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">If possible, don't quit your job until you have another one.</li>
<li type="1">If you've lost your job, take the first offer you get even if it's not optimal, cash flow is important.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<li type="A">Ideas for what to include in your resume</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">While searching, double check Remote or Hybrid, the hourly pay rates, etc.</li>
<li type="1">Before sending a resume, or clicking EASY APPLY, verify the hourly rate, so that you don't apply for a job with too little pay.</li>
<li type="1">Google now has a dedicated job search presentation, truly amazing and worthwhile.  Search terms like &quot;Remote Linux Bash job&quot; work very well.</li>
<li type="1">Best to post the same resume on LinkedIn, Dice, and Indeed, to minimize confusion when recruiters are reviewing your resume.</li>
<li type="1">If the job requirements list certain skills, put those skills below the Education section, so the recruiter or hiring manager doesn't have to look for them.</li>
<li type="1">As you write your resume, save it frequently to avoid data loss.</li>
<li type="1">Until 2022, I had never heard of a recruiter offering to re-structure a resume for me. The first solid contact I had in the 2022 job search asked if he could re-structure my resume and I told him yes, please do so. He said, &quot;No one knows what a resume should look like in any given job market. But I know, because I'm a recruiter.&quot;</li>
<li type="1">It's even worth letting the recruiter know in the initial email or phone call that you'd appreciate suggestions for tailoring your resume to ensure the best first impression.  This can only help your job search efforts.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">Resume heading example</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">The resume heading should be centered at the top of the page, and could look like this:</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">First name, Last name</li>
<li type="1">City, State, Zip code (I never put street addresses in resumes.)</li>
<li type="1">Your JOB SEARCH EMAIL ACCOUNT email address.</li>
<li type="1">Phone number (if desired, but makes it easier for your recruiter to find it.</li>
<li type="1">https://www.linkedin.com/in/firstname.lastname (Or however your LinkedIn ID appears.)</li>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">Education list example</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Put education (trade schools, colleges, etc.) below the heading of your resume, i.e. below the linkedin.com line:</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Associates' Degree, A-1 Technical Academy, Pittsburgh, PA. (Year graduated: 2023)</li>
<li type="1">B.A. Physics, Such-and-such University, New York, NY. (Year graduated: 2026)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">The best format for previous employers and dates you were there</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Company, Full Time or Contractor, start date --- end date --- job title</li>
<li type="1">(See items J and K below.)</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">More hints for a good resume</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">If it's been awhile since you've used a secondary skillset, e.g. If it's been 15 years since you worked with COBOL, be sure to let the recruiter know that, he or she will understand</li>
<li type="1">Below the current job or most recent job, explain in 90 - 100 words what skills you learned in the position and how you used them to provide value to the company vs. keeping the coffee pot on. This is a good place to provide a few details for your next potential employer.</li>
<li type="1">In every one of the reverse-chronological job histories, briefly mention how your primary skillset (and others) were used.</li>
<li type="1">Use this as the descriptive line above each separate entry in your reverse chronological job history:</li>
</ol>

<li type="A">Previous job example 1</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">FICTITIOUS COMPANY NAME BELOW:</li>
<li type="1">Tomorrow's Most Awesome SuperKewl Technologies, Contractor, 2023 --- 2025 --- Linux System Engineer (Orange Ball Cap Linux,) Operations Engineer 2.2</li>

<ol>
<li type="1">FICTITIOUS COMPANY NAME BELOW:</li>
<li type="1">The Last Financial Management Company You'll Ever Need, Full Time, 2025 --- 2028 --- Linux DevOps Engineer (Magenta Magic Linux,) Web systems designer.</li>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">When your resume is complete</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">When your resume is complete, save a backup copy, go to your home page on LinkedIn and update these areas:</li>
<li type="1">Your Headline, which appears under your profile picture. Click the pencil icon to the right of your picture. Edit the headline and put the most compelling skill sets there, start the line with 10 years of Linux, or 5 years of PostgreSQL, or 2 years of Docker, or whatever your BEST skillset is, then follow that with other important skills.</li>
<li type="1">In the same area, click "Add profile section" and create or update your profile. This should be equal to or closely match your resume.</li>
<li type="1">To the left of the Add profile section, click Open to, and click Finding a new job or Providing services. This will add a green border to your profile picture and helps get attention quickly.</li>
<li type="1">After updating your profile and Open to areas, click Take a skill quiz in your area of expertise. These are fairly easy to pass and when you do, a trophy icon will appear next to your name in job listings, another way to attract attention.</li>
<li type="1">This seems to mark your profile as updated/new material, and gets attention.</li>
<li type="1">When I've done this there is a small to medium spike in emails and calls.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">While waiting for calls, emails, txts, and interviews.....</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">After the resume(s) are completed and uploaded, go into &quot;maintenance mode.&quot;</li>
<li type="1">Watch for missed phone calls, txt messages, and check your job search email account frequently.</li>
<li type="1">Make sure the voicemail box has space.</li>
<li type="1">That new voicemail could be your next job.</li>
<li type="1">Periodically (once a week or once a month) refresh your linkedin, dice, and indeed profiles.</li>
<li type="1">In 2023, quite a few recruiters are sending an email to you with a short TXT message immediately afterward to get your attention.</li>
<li type="1">A method to reduce interruptions after receiving emails and TXTs: reply to the TXT or email with a message similar to the following:</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Hello (Name of recruiter,) The job looks very interesting. I'd like to discuss this on a phone call.</li>
<li type="1">Are you available to talk after 4pm when I am off work?</li>
<li type="1">Please send a TXT a few minutes before you'd like to talk to be sure I am in a non-work area.</li>
</ol>

</ol>

</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">Things to remember during recruiter cold-calls and interviews</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Find out the probable rate early in the call: About 30 seconds into the call with a recruiter, ask about the upper dollar per hour rate the client is willing to pay, since some jobs may not pay as much as you expected. If the amount is nowhere near your current rate, let the recruiter know your rate, politely thank them, and invite them to contact you again if the client is willing to pay your desired rate.
<li type="1">STILL.....in a difficult economy, be flexible; if unemployed, you need &quot;A JOB,&quot; even if the rate is lower than you'd otherwise accept.</li>
<li type="1">It is essentially impossible to increase your rate to what it should have been after agreeing to the rate in the email that will be sent to you to finalize the deal. Know your desired rate !!</li>
<li type="1">As a contractor, there are usually no benefits included (but ask if any are,) if not, then set your rate high enough to provide the level of benefits at your last full time position. It seems $2000/month is a good average value to start with.</li>
<li type="1">To get the $2000/month to buy benefits, increase your hourly rate by an extra $12.50 ($2000/(8 hrs/day * 5 days/week * 4 weeks/month)) will provide the $2000 extra per month for benefits.</li>
<li type="1">It's up to you to take care of yourself (and your family) by charging an adequate hourly rate.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li type="A">In-Person or Video interviews</li>
<ol>
<li type="1">Know your desired hourly rate before replying to a posting.  $40, $50, $60, $70, $80, $90 per hour, etc.  do not be afraid to ask for your true worth.</li>
<li type="1">Best to wear a freshly pressed white shirt and tie during the interview.</li>
<li type="1">Take notes during the interview and study new technologies and terms that are discussed.</li>
