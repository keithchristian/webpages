Certificates:
OWASP 10 Requirements (2023.)

Application Development: I have written hundreds of bash, tcl, and expect scripts including a custom KPI gathering
system for predictive analytics, host self-diagnosis, and enhanced messaging, to identify physical, virtual,
and containerized machines which are trending toward degraded states.

Scripted maintenance routines for Linux servers (Red Hat,) and utility functions with Bash, Expect, TCL, Perl,
Awk, etc. to maintain free disk space, throttle file transfers, monitor for lost connectivity, and mitigate DDOS
and other threats to systems.

Wrote and deployed two large software projects of approximately 3000 lines of TCL Expect code and Shell scripts
for automatically offloading data files to high-capacity storage and analytics systems.

Proficient with installing and configuring Mysql.
Facilitate data conversion between MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.
Working experience with SQL queries.
Configure logging, Backup procedures.
Designing tables, assigning proper data types, creating indexes.

Created a website for a non-profit from scratch with Linux, Apache and PHP, chose hosting provider and successfully
deployed it.

Web:
Proficient with HTML, CSS.
Familar with the Apache web server.

Skillsets:
Linux 20+ years, familiar with Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux.  I can help with OS
upgrade projects.
Solaris: 4 years experience in a previous position.
Ansible. Manage devices, collect data for improved performance and reliability.
Bash shell: 20+ years. Hundreds of bash scripts written for automation, disk clean up, system monitoring, etc.
Korn shell: 5 years.  I have written ksh scripts written for legacy systems not equipped with other shells.
MySQL, 1 year.  Write SQL queries, export data from MySQL, clean data for importation into PostgreSQL.
PostgreSQL, 1 year. Automated data imports from MySQL, write SQL queries, create reports for further automation.

Windows Server:
1 year equivalent experience spread across 20 years in IT.

Security and Recent Project History:
Detect and block DDOS attacks at the host system.
Throttle data transfers to avoid network and CPU saturation, and similar use cases.
Mitigated DDOS and scans with fail2ban, along with a custom blocking package written in an afternoon, based on
tcpdump and iptables, and the GNU toolset.
Fail2ban: Helps prevent systems from being compromised from outside actors. Stops inbound high frequency scans
within a few seconds of appearance. I know how to finesse Fail2ban's configuration files for best reliability.

What sets Keith Christian apart from the rest?
20+ years of Linux System Administration and coding skills.
I excel at tracking down problems in infrastructure that are missed by monitoring systems.
If a particular parameter isn't monitored, I generally find a way to do so.
I create custom scripts that look for and report changes in filesystems such as gargantuan space-consuming crash
dumps, Java coredumps, and more.
My scripts can analyze files and delete or move files to increase disk space on the affected drive or partition.
To avoid needless human intervention, most of my tested, targeted maintenance scripts are set to run as a cron
job so that the solution requires minimal, or no, human intervention.
For urgent and fast processing of massive datasets or quick automation jobs, I am proficient with shell script
parallelization.
I know how to develop, debug, and deploy emergency fixes or other code on production devices IF no QA environments
are available (e.g. architectures where expensive applications and hardware make production the only available
environment.)
